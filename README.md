# Flutter WebRTC Project

*What is Flutter-WebRTC?*


Flutter-WebRTC is a plugin for the Flutter framework that enables real-time communication (RTC) capabilities in web and mobile applications. It is a collection of communication protocols and APIs that allow direct communication between web browsers and mobile applications without third-party plugins or software. With Flutter-WebRTC, you can easily build video call applications without dealing with the underlying technologies' complexities.
